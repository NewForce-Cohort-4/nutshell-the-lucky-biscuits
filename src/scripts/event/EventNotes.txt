The Event List component allows the user to to input an event name, date, and location into a form. When the user saves the new event it appears in the DOM along with all other events.

What files will I need?
    - Event.js (renders HTML to create a single event card)
    - EventDataProvider.js (fetch calls to and from API)
    - EventList.js (prints all event cards to the DOM and prioritizes the next event with bold font and larger card size)
    - EventForm.js (renders an HTML form to input event information)

What functions and event listners will I need?
    - Event.js
        - Event() function to render a single HTML card

    - EventDataProvider.js 
        - getEvents() and useEvents() for API fetch calls and to allow us to use the data in the database
        - saveEvent() to save a new event to the database when the user clicks the "save" button
    
    - EventList.js
        - EventList() function to print all the events to the DOM and sort events by date and priortize the next event with bold font and larger card size

    - EventForm.js
        - Form() to render an HTML for to allow user input
        - eventListener on the save button of the form

How can I get the next event on the agenda to hvae bold text and a slightly larger size?
    - Sort the array of events in useEvents


What functions will I need to invoke and where?

    - Get new events to save to the database based on the uer that is saving them userById
